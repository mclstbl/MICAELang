## To use

The packages will need to be installed the first time MICAELang is built
```
npm install
```

A build script handles the documentation generation and also starting the server. Run the following from the repo root directory
```
./build.sh
```

And visit <http://localhost:3000/>. 

WARNING: This has only been tested on Mac OSX so :)
