// ## Testing
// Test plan -- how the program/system was verified. Put the actual test results in the Appendix. This section is useful if your project is more on the software engineering side than research focused.

// ## Results
// This covers different areas to the 'Testing' chapter, and is appropriate for 'research style' projects. For such projects this chapter should detail the types of experiments/simulations that were carried out with the code written. Why were certain experiments carried out but not others? What were the important parameters in the simulation and how did they affect the results? If there are very many graphs and tables associated with this chapter they may be put in the Appendix, but it is generally better to keep these close to the text they illustrate, as this is easier for the reader.

// ## Conclusion, Evaluation and Further Work
// What have you achieved? Give a critical appraisal (evaluation) of your own work - how could the work be taken further (perhaps by another student next year)?

// This file will contain report sections after Implementation
